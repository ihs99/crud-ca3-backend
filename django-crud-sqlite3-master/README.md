I have created this web application created with Django with the Django python framework. It is a course management application where you can add, modify and delete courses with their code, name, credits, and options of subjects or courses you want to do. A simple but complete application. With this CRUD application we can add the courses we want as if we wanted to create the web page of a University, when I add or modify a course a message will appear warning me of each change we make. I have created this application on the basis of the first works CA1 and CA2. I have managed to create it with the python programming language, Django and also the bootstrap framework for the CSS code, a SQLite3 database, using the MTV architecture pattern (Model - Template - View).
